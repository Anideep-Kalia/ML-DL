# AI / ML Learning Portfolio

A curated collection of hands-on projects and experiments across **Machine Learning, NLP, Deep Learning, and backend APIs**.  
This repo documents my learning journey — focusing on **practical implementation, not just theory**.

Organized by topic. Each folder contains code, notebooks, and (where relevant) notes on what I learned.
